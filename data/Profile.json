    "Summary": "I’m a Software Engineer focused on building secure, reliable solutions across the Microsoft Power Platform and full-stack (.NET, Node, Angular, React). On my current federal program (NIH/NHLBI), I’m trusted to lead maintenance and modernization for 12+ applications, define practical governance and ALM, and mentor teammates so solutions stay fast, testable, and compliant.  Recent outcomes include 30–50% cycle-time reductions, $50K–$200K in annual license cost avoidance via architecture patterns (on-prem gateway + Key Vault + REST), and a zero-downtime migration of a 200+ user Angular app to SharePoint Online with Microsoft Entra ID. I also drive developer productivity with AI-assisted workflows using Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), and ChatGPT for code generation, refactoring, documentation, and planning.  Core focus: Power Apps (Canvas/Model-driven), Power Automate, Power BI, Dataverse, AI Builder, ALM (Power Platform Pipelines, PAC CLI, Managed Environments), CI/CD, and integrations with SharePoint and secure on-prem data. Comfortable blending low-code and full-code to deliver durable, maintainable software.",
